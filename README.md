# Techdegree Project 1
 random_quote_generator

Greetings!

This project is a test of proper implementation of Javascript mechanics such as functions, arrays, objects, loops, and conditionals. 

I have compiled a list of 5 quotes from some of my more cherished books to display the use of these mechanics.

In addition to displaying the quote, this project stores the values of author (source), book (citation), publication year (year), and, in some cases, tags attributed to the quote.

As an added display of JavaScript knowledge and an additional aesthetical element, I have coded a function to return a random background color each time a new quote is pulled. 

The quotes will automatically refresh after 7 seconds of display to allow for reading time.

Cheers and enjoy the quote!
